# Tech-Addiction-Problem-Solving-and-Design-Thinking-

Problem Statement: MOULIK, A UNIVERSITY STUDENT FACING TECH. ADDICTION DUE TO ALL THE CLASSES GOING ONLINE AND DEPENDING ON VIRTUAL MODE EVEN TO PERFORM HIS SMALL TASKS. 

This project was initialized by me in my first year of Computer Science Engineering.
The project focuses on how tech addiction in underage children can b solved by using the concepts of Problem Solving and Design Thinking.
The solution is clearly illustrated with the help of a empathy map, pain and gain points, mind mapping, prototype poster and feedback.

Hence, from the project it is clear that most of the users think that SETTING UP A TIME LIMIT is the best way of avoiding tech addictionâ€¦
